# ðŸ’¹ CryptoSpark NZ

CryptoSpark NZ is a responsive web application for tracking the worldâ€™s most popular cryptocurrencies in real time, with all prices displayed in **New Zealand Dollars (NZD)**.  

The app is built with **React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and shadcn/ui**, and features a clean, modern interface. It highlights the top three cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Tether) in visually appealing cards with a custom **Electric Border animation** for a futuristic trading look.  

> Repo originally scaffolded with **[Lovable.dev](https://lovable.dev/)**, then customized and extended with unique features, styling, and animations.  
> Styling and animation design were enhanced with **AI-assisted support**.

## Features

- Real-time NZD prices for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Tether  
- Live data fetched from the **[CoinGecko API](https://www.coingecko.com/)**  
- Animated glowing borders around crypto cards via a custom `ElectricBorder` component  
- Fully responsive design for desktop, tablet, and mobile  
- Modern styling with **TailwindCSS** and **shadcn/ui**  
- Fast and lightweight thanks to **Vite + React**

## Data Source

CryptoSpark NZ does not include its own backend server.  
Instead, it fetches live cryptocurrency market data directly from the **CoinGecko API** using a custom React hook (`useCryptoData.ts`).  

This approach keeps the app lightweight while still providing real-time NZD price updates.  
Future improvements could include adding a Node.js/Express backend and database for features like user accounts, saved watchlists, and historical data.

## Animation Inspiration

The **Electric Border effect** was inspired by and adapted from a demo on **[ReactBits.dev](https://reactbits.dev/animations/electric-border)** â€” a site showcasing interactive React animation tutorials and code samples.  

The implementation was then extended and customized for this project to give the crypto cards their glowing, animated frames.
